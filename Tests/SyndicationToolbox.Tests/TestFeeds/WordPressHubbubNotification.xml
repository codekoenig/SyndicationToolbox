I know it is the old logo, but I have always liked this one.</p>
<p>Below is details of the <strong>Dexterity Fundamentals</strong> training class:</p>
<h3>Dexterity I (Dexterity Product Fundamentals)</h3>
<h4>Course Synopsis:</h4>
<p>Dexterity I will teach you about the development environment used to build the Microsoft Dynamics GP family of products. This course will provide you with the foundation you need to build integrated, database-independent applications. In addition, you will learn how to provide powerful application functionality for Dynamics.</p>
<p>By actively participating in this class, you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic programming techniques used by Microsoft Dynamics GP to develop their core modules</li>
<li>How to modify existing Dynamics GP forms and reports in order to make customizations for customers</li>
<li>How to develop add-on applications that will interact with the Dynamics GP products to meet specific requests by customers</li>
<li>How to package and ship your dictionary allowing Microsoft Dynamics GP to make updates to Dynamics GP without affecting the developer’s dictionary</li>
<li>How to register your product with Microsoft Dynamics GP using a unique Product ID to ensure no duplication of add-on applications with the same name</li>
<li>How to develop add-on applications that will “look and feel” like Dynamics GP and provide seamless interface between the applications to ensure a professional finished product</li>
<li>How to use object triggers, which are scripts in your applications that are invoked by events in Dynamics GP, allowing several developers to deliver enhancements to the same Dynamics GP form</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who should attend?</h4>
<p>Customers or Partners who will be customizing or building add-on or standalone applications to integrate with the Dynamics GP products.</p>
<h4>Special Instructions</h4>
